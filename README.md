## Description

The Explosive Eggs Minecraft Plugin is a fun and exciting addition to your Minecraft server. With this plugin, you can add a twist to the classic act of throwing eggs by making them explode in a variety of random and surprising ways. Whether you want to add some chaos to your server or create unique in-game challenges, this plugin is the perfect choice.

## Features

- **Egg Explosions:** When players throw eggs, they won't just crack or hatch chickens as usual. Instead, the eggs will explode in unpredictable and exciting ways, adding an element of surprise to your Minecraft world.

- **Random Outcomes:** The explosions are entirely random, so you never know what to expect. From small fireworks displays to large fiery explosions, the plugin keeps the game engaging and dynamic.

- **Customization:** You can configure the explosion outcomes and intensity, allowing you to tailor the experience to your server's preferences. Adjust explosion sizes, particle effects, and more.

- **Permissions:** You have control over who can use explosive eggs on your server by assigning permissions. Set permissions for different player groups to manage the chaos.

- **No Dependencies:** This plugin is lightweight and designed to work seamlessly with your Spigot server. It doesn't require any additional plugins or mods.
